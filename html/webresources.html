            <li><p><a href="http://w3schools.com">w3schools</a><br />
              In the web-resources, there are HTML and CSS, JavaScript, Server Side,
              Data Analytics, Programming language, Web Building and XML Tutorials.
              Each tutorial has a well-organized table of contents, so it is useful to find and 
              use the necessary information like a dictionary.
              In addition, it provides good information to students learning web applications 
              as all the basic contents necessary for web application. <br /><br />

            <li><p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a><br />
              Code Academy has online classes that teach the languages of various programs.
              It provides class such as python, php, jquary, javascript, ruby, html, css.
              It is a good environment to study alone. 
              In addition, a differentiated feedback system stimulates study, so you will work hard.
              I would like to spend time on API classes because I lack the API concept. <br /><br />

              <li><p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/">coursera</a><br />

                It offers huge online classes. You can take classes from famous universities, 
                and it helps you to master the skills of the classes you take. 
                The class I was interested in was a web application class run by Michigan State University.
                 However, since it is a little difficult, 
                 I think it will be useful for people who work in the field but want to learn more. <br /><br />

                  TheNewBoston is for those who want to take a class with a little bit of freedom. 
                  Mostly a YouTube channel that teaches you HTML, CSS, Node JS, Python, and languages and frameworks.
                  In particular, the React JS class is well organized, so it seems to be of great help.
                  However, since it deals only with simple concepts, it seems suitable for students learning the basics.

                    JavaScript has been mainly used in the front-end field. However, with the advent of 'Node JS', its purpose has completely changed. Thanks to the framework called NodeJS, it is now possible to control server-side technology with JavaScript.
                    It is receiving a lot of attention from web developers, and recently a foundation was established, and technology development is actively taking place.
                    From this website, you can download NodeJS, and it provides information you can learn.
                    NodeJS is used a lot in web applications, so you should check it out if you are interested in it.
